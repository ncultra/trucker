Place source images for cloning in this directory. Trucker will then
clone the image to create a new VM instance.

"clones" is a misnomer because the images are backing files for
potential clones; not clones per se.

Trucker will append ".seed" to the filename of each image in this
directory. tty_small.qcow2 will become tty_small.qcow2.seed.
